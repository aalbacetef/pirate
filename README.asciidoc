== Introduction 

image::misc/pirate-ship.jpg[] 

**Pirate** is a webhooks task runner. It aims to satisfy the need for running tasks based on webhook events.

Example config (explained below).
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  # optional: defaults to 'localhost'
  host: localhost

  # required: port on which to listen to 
  port: 3939

  # optional: maximum time allowed for a request, defaults to 5m0s 
  request-timeout: '5m0s'

  logging:
    # required: logging directory.
    #   Will be created with permission 744 if it doesn't exist
    #   Filename will be pirate.YYYY-MM-DD--hh:mm:ss.log
    dir: './logs' 

    ## NOTE: special value :stdout: writes to standard output
    # dir: ':stdout:'


handlers:
  # NOTE: all fields of the handler are required unless stated otherwise
  - endpoint: /webhooks/simple
    name: simple webhook handler

    # optional: handler execution policy, one of: drop, queue, parallel. Defaults to queue.
    policy: drop 

    # authenticates the handler based on the value of the X-Authorization header 
    auth:
      # a list validator will check if the token matches one of .token
      validator: list
      token: 
        - alpha
        - beta
    # script to run, the request headers and body are available as env vars.
    run: |
      SOME_VAR="some-variable"
      echo "SOME_VAR: $SOME_VAR"
      echo "body: $PIRATE_BODY"
      echo "headers: $PIRATE_HEADERS" 
      echo "header param: $PIRATE_HEADERS_SOME_PARAM"


  - endpoint: /new-release
    name: new release
    policy: queue
    auth:
      # a command validator will pass if the run block exits with code = 0.
      validator: command
      run: |
        echo "offloading validation to another program"
        ./path/to/validator --token="$PIRATE_TOKEN" --name="$PIRATE_NAME"
    run: | 
      # one can call scripts from the run block, this which makes it easier
      # to implement complex workflows
      ./scripts/handle-new-release.sh  "$PIRATE_BODY"

== Installation

=== Docker 

We provide a docker image for ease of use. 

The recommended way of using it is to mount your ship config as well as any needed directories. 

Example:

[source,bash]
----
docker run --rm -it \
  -v ./logs/:/app/logs \
  -v ./ship.yml:/app/ship.yml \
  -v /var/www/html:/app/blog-html \
  -p 39390:39390 \
  aalbacetef/pirate:latest
----

**Tips**

Don't forget to set `server.host` to `0.0.0.0`. 
Some users might find it useful to set the logging to standard output, while others would prefer to mount the log directory.


== Configuration

Pirate uses a YAML configuration file (`ship.yml`) to define server settings, logging, and webhook handlers.

=== Server Configuration

The `server` section defines how Pirate listens for incoming webhook requests.

[source,yaml]
----
server:
  host: localhost       # Optional: Defaults to 'localhost'
  port: 3939            # Required: The port Pirate listens on
  request-timeout: '5m' # Optional: Defaults to 5 minutes
----

- *`host`* (optional) - The address Pirate binds to. Defaults to `localhost`.
- *`port`* (required) - The port number Pirate listens on.
- *`request-timeout`* (optional) - Maximum duration for processing a request (default: `5m`).

=== Logging Configuration

The `logging` section controls where logs are stored.

[source,yaml]
----
logging:
  dir: './logs'  # Required: Log directory or `:stdout:` for console output
----

- *`dir`* (required) - Directory where logs are saved.
  - If the directory does not exist, Pirate creates it with **744 permissions**.
  - Log files follow the format: `pirate.YYYY-MM-DD--HH:mm:ss.log`.
  - Special value `:stdout:` writes logs to standard output.

=== Webhook Handlers

The `handlers` section defines webhook endpoints, authentication, and execution scripts.

==== Example Handler

[source,yaml]
----
handlers:
  - endpoint: /webhooks/simple
    name: simple webhook handler
    policy: drop
    auth:
      validator: list
      token: 
        - alpha
        - beta
    run: |
      echo "body: $PIRATE_BODY"
      echo "headers: $PIRATE_HEADERS"
----

Each handler includes:

* *`endpoint`* (required) - The URL path for this webhook (e.g., `/webhooks/simple`).
* *`name`* (required) - A human-readable name for the handler.
* *`policy`* (optional) - Execution policy. One of `drop`, `parallel`, `queue`. Defaults to `queue`. 
** `drop`: if webhook events come in while the handler is already running, they will be dropped.
** `parallel`: handlers will run as webhooks come in.
** `queue`: handlers will be queued as they come in.
* *`auth`* (required, one of `list` or `command`) - Authentication method:
** *`validator: list`* - Checks if the `X-Authorization` header matches one of the provided tokens.
** *`validator: command`* - Runs a script and passes authentication if it exits with `0`.
* *`run`* (required) - A shell script executed when the webhook is triggered. Available environment variables:
** `$PIRATE_BODY`: The request body.
** `$PIRATE_HEADERS`: All request headers.
** `$PIRATE_HEADERS_<HEADER_NAME>`: A specific header value.

==== Authentication Methods

===== Token-based Authentication

[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  validator: list
  token: 
    - alpha
    - beta
----

Passes if `X-Authorization` header matches one of the values of the `token` list, in this case: `alpha` or `beta`.

===== Command-based Authentication

[source,yaml]
----
auth:
  validator: command
  run: |
    echo "running validation via a script"
    ./scripts/validate-user.sh "$PIRATE_TOKEN"
----

Passes if the run block exits with exit code 0. 
The `X-Authorization` header's value is exposed as an environment variable: `PIRATE_TOKEN`.
The handler name is exposed as an environment variable: `PIRATE_NAME`.

=== Running External Scripts

Pirate allows running external scripts to handle complex workflows.

[source,yaml]
----
run: |
  ./scripts/handle-new-release.sh
----
